Palindrome String App:
Gets a word through prompt and prints YES if it is a ” palindrome string” and NO otherwise. It continues receiving new
phrases until the user sends an empty string. On empty string the window will prompt the user that application will go back
to the home page.

100 Boxes App:
Implements a web page which consists of a form which accepts following inputs:
1. A group of RadioButtons with these values.
a. Random
b. Square
c. Circle
After the customer clicks the button, the app creates 100 boxes and locates them based on the
value of RadioButton. When the mouse moves over a box, the box is removed from the
div. When the div has one child box, an alert pop up that says, "last child!".
For example, if the random is selected, the app locates boxes inside a div with the id
container.
If the Circle is chosen, locates the boxes in a circular shape inside the div of the boxes.
If the user clicks "Generate More" button, 100 more random boxes will be generated.
